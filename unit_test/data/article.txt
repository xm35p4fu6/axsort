Windhelm is a city in northeastern Skyrim with the dubious honour of being considered the snowiest.
There are some 600,000 different jobs in the world. Inevitably, it can be hard to know which one might be best suited to our talents and temperament. This is a game designed to help us determinewhat occupation could be most relevant to us. Each of the 52 cards details a highly distinctive and often fascinating profession with ratings for key factors, such as stress levels, salary and meaning, to bring our ambitions into focus. The cards work together as a fun and competitive trump game but beneath the play, the game is also trying to help us with one of the most serious tasks we face: knowing what we might usefully do with the rest of our lives.
